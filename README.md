# daily-planner-Application

## Task Description

I will build a daily calendar planner that will help the user to manage his time.
The user will be able to save any future event within any chosen working hour session of the day .
The calendar planner will be styled the way that the user will visually see and make a difference among the current , past and future events .

## Pseudo code description

- When the user open the application , the current date and time is display on top f the page

- 8 timeblocks are displayed at the bottom from 9AM to 5PM

- The time block displaying the current time , the past time and the future time are labeled with a specific color that differentiate them.

- If i click on a timeblock , i can entered a text

- if i enter a text , i can save if using a save button

- if i refresh the page , the text is still displaying

## Git Repository

I created a git repository folder that will host the finish website. The Repository will be found [here](https://github.com/pfansi/daily-planner)

## What have you done

- Created a readme.md file to describe the different building phases of the application.
